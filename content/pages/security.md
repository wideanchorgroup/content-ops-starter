          #### Employee Awareness


          At Locus Robotics, security resilience starts with people. Our
          top-down approach to security awareness education creates a holistic
          culture across all technical and non-technical departments. Employee
          awareness is the foundation for secure processes, practices, and
          technologies.


          #### Assurance


          Based on a principle of mature foundations, we build security into
          everything from our cloud customer portal to our robots executing
          instructions. We leverage the latest methods of encryption (in
          transmission and at rest). We continuously monitor the effectiveness
          of our controls, taking a continuous compliance assurance approach to
          mitigate risk across the product and service lifecycle.

          #### Security Incident Preparedness


          Locus Robotics acknowledges and continuously prepares for security
          incidents through education and awareness efforts, and building
          security into our work processes and product. Our leadership
          established and practices Incident Response processes, based on
          industry standards, to ensure proper decision making steps are known
          and followed. We analyze and respond to events with the key priority
          to protect our customers from any impact of an event.
