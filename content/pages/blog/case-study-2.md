Features:

Relying on the global robot data platform of Qinglang, Qinglang has laid a solid foundation for the flexible obstacle avoidance and stable operation performance of medical delivery robots through continuous optimization and upgrading of algorithms. With its leading cognitive, decision-making and execution capabilities, the X101 medical delivery robot has won the industry's first comprehensive intelligence level L3 certification. In terms of hardware, the X101 delivery robot uses a wrap-around layout of dual laser radars and "front 3 + rear 1" stereo vision modules to achieve 360Â° no-dead-angle perception and recognition of the surrounding environment in low-light or strong light source scenes such as hospital reflections, dark light, and night, and flexibly avoid obstacles to "clear" obstacles on the road of material transportation.

**Reasons for participation:**

The X101 robot of Qinglang Medical is equipped with an intelligent RFID (radio frequency identification) reader. After the materials with RFID tags are loaded into the box, it can automatically identify the destination without manual input and automatically optimize the route, which is convenient and fast. Medical staff can view and trace the location and status of medical supplies in real time through the background, so that all transported items can be "traceable", meeting the hospital's needs for information control and real-time viewing of medical supplies.
